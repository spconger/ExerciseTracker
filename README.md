# ExerciseTracker
<p>This is an application that tracks exercises, weights and calories. I post it, especially for the students in my IT 112 class to show 
extra techniques and tools that are not explicitly covered in class: these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using aggregate functions with data</li>
<li>writing classes in the model file that are not models but are used to manipulate model data</li>
<li>limiting the number of records to display</li>
<li>sorting or ordering the records displayed</li>
<li>Passing multiple values in the view context</li>
<li>Using if statements and other python structures in templates</li>
</ul>
<p>The first commit included all the models, views, and templates. I hope to add more comments and to expand the tests to show a complete set of 
unit tests.</p>
